Todo:

- impr ex_s.s
- todo gbainline.h timeshift
- improve swi code / swi some more asyncsync: 
- allow GBAEmu4ds to use IRQ_HBLANK, IRQ_VBLANK and IRQ_VCOUNTER through hardware interrupts rather than patching them (that causes a massive slowdown)
- hwreg 0x301 in CPUWriteByte
- fix cpu pc rel reads/writes		<-- means we need to fix prefetch handler
- usermode reads firq and mode sw
- not alined ichfly_readdma_rom
- fix reads from unreadable mem (homebrews use this for sets) 
- GSA_SLOWDOWN
- execute bios code (for BIOS splashscreen) (or actually Stub it, as VBA would do). For both cases a MPU interrupt should happen and deal with game logic (so it doesn't fetch 0x0 unmapped data)

patcher: (prefetcher?)
- str oldValue
- 0x1DC0DE
- decrypter

Coto:

this emulator works because: 

1)
ARM v4 and v5 (ARM7 and ARM9) support the CP15 bus interface:

2)
ARM allows 32 bytes of placeholder vectors: 1) at 0x00000000 and 2) at 0xffff0000, (by default gbaemu4ds). Thing is: 0xffff0000 is BIOS ROM, gbaemu4ds can't use that code 
since gba code is ran through a hypervisor. So I manually overwrite the 0x00000000 vectors (for the time being) until a better solution is found. Do note, ARM seem to
provide a 32byte vector read/writable memory embedded inside the ARM core, of which can be set to 0xffff0000 or 0x00000000 through CP15.


Emulated vectors are 512 bytes, and they run from within a branch armv4 opcode range (32Megabytes of addressing both forward the current PC and backwards).
These vectors act as a whole BIOS replacement. It means it does not use the NTR abort handler, but the official ARM exception vector methods.
Check arm9/tgba_arm9.ld file for details.
